                    <p class="what">
                       &nbsp;&nbsp;Education is another area which has adopted Virtual Reality for teaching and learning situations. The advantage of this is that it enables large groups of students to interact with each other as well as within a three dimensional environment.<br>It is able to present complex data in an accessible way to students which is both fun and easy to learn. Plus these students can interact with the objects in that environment in order to discover more about them.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, astronomy students can learn about the solar system and how it works by physical engagement with the objects within. They can move planets, see around stars and track the progress of a comet. This also enables them to see how abstract concepts work in a three dimensional environment which makes them easier to understand and retain.

                    <h1>Military</h1>
                    <p class="what">
                       &nbsp;&nbsp;Virtual Reality has been adopted by the military – this includes all three services (army, navy and air force) – where it is used for training purposes. This is particularly useful for training soldiers for combat situations or other dangerous settings where they have to learn how to react in an appropriate manner.<br>
                        A virtual reality simulation enables them to do so but without the risk of death or a serious injury. They can re-enact a particular scenario, for example engagement with an enemy in an environment in which they experience this but without the real world risks. This has proven to be safer and less costly than traditional training methods.
                        <br>
                        These include:<br>
                           &nbsp;&nbsp; - Flight Simulation<br>
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;  - Battlefield Simulation<br>
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;  - Medic training (battlefield)<br>
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;  - Vehicle simulation<br>
                           &nbsp;&nbsp; - Virtual boot camp<br>
                        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        Virtual reality is also used to treat post-traumatic stress disorder. Soldiers suffering from battlefield trauma and other psychological conditions can learn how to deal with their symptoms in a ‘safe’ environment. The idea is for them to be exposed to the triggers for their condition which they gradually adjust to. This has the effect of decreasing their symptoms and enabling them to cope to new or unexpected situations.
                        This is discussed further in the virtual reality treatment for PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder) article.

                       &nbsp;&nbsp;Healthcare is one of the biggest adopters of virtual reality which encompasses surgery simulation, phobia treatment, robotic surgery and skills training.
                        One of the advantages of this technology is that it allows healthcare professionals to learn new skills as well as refreshing existing ones in a safe environment. Plus it allows this without causing any danger to the patients.

                       &nbsp;&nbsp;Virtual reality is being used in a number of ways by the business community which include:<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;- Virtual tours of a business environment<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;- Training of new employees<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;- A 360 view of a product<br><br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;Many businesses have embraced virtual reality as a cost effective way of developing a<br> product or service. For example it enables-  them to test a prototype without having to<br> develop several versions of this which can be time consuming and expensive.
                        Plus it is a good way of detecting design problems at an early stage which can then be dealt with sooner rather than later.

                    <p class="what">
                      Virtual reality engineering includes the use of 3D modelling tools and visualisation techniques as part of the design process. This technology enables engineers to view their project in 3D and gain a greater understanding of how it works. Plus they can spot any flaws or potential risks before implementation.
This also allows the design team to observe their project within a safe environment and make changes as and where necessary. This saves both time and money.
What is important is the ability of virtual reality to depict fine grained details of an engineering product to maintain the illusion. This means high end graphics, video with a fast refresh rate and realistic sound and movement.

                    <p class="what">
                     Virtual reality is used as a training aid in many sports such as golf, athletics, skiing, cycling etc. It is used as an aid to measuring athletic performance as well as analysing technique and is designed to help with both of these. It also used in clothing/equipment design and as part of the drive to improve the audience’s experience.
 
The athlete uses this technology to fine tune certain aspects of their performance, for example, a golfer looking to improve their swing or a track cyclist wanting to go faster in the individual pursuit. Three dimensional systems can pinpoint aspects of an athlete’s performance which require changing, for example, their biomechanics or technique.

                    <p class="what">
                    TV : 
Virtual reality has featured in several film and television programmes. It is often used to illustrate the concept of being trapped within the machine (or in this case, cyberspace), or as a form of advanced technology.
Examples of VR inspired films include:
The Lawnmower Man
The Matrix
Tron (1982 version)
The Thirteenth Floor
eXistenZ
Vanilla Sky
And then there are television programmes such as selected episodes of Doctor Who, Red Dwarf and Star Trek: The Next Generation which utilise virtual reality technology. One example is the holodeck as seen in Star Trek which enables the person to experience any situation they so wish.
 
Music : 
This technology has formed part of experimental sound displays and sound installations. Another use is virtual reality musical instruments which the person can interact with these instruments as a new type of performance or to create new compositions.
 
Books : 
Virtual reality has been a staple theme of many fictional stories such as William Gibson’s Neuromancer and Mona Lisa Overdrive as well as Orson Scott Card’s Enders Game.
 
Arts : 
There are artists who use virtual reality to explore certain ideas or concepts. They create a three dimensional environment as a form of communication with the audience. One example is the work of Kenneth Rinaldo who uses robotics and augmented reality to explore ideas related to the human-technology boundary.

                    Telecommunications is another field which has utilised virtual reality technology, in particular mobile communications which enables easy access to a variety of VR based projects.
The main challenge is that of dealing with a medium which mainly relies upon tone of voice, intonation, gesture and body language as compared to spoken words. In fact, spoken words only account for a very small percentage of the overall communication.
But traditional forms of communication such as the telephone are being superseded by video conferencing, Skype and live chat. These communication mediums can be used on the internet and other similar systems and are seen as cheaper and more flexible.

                    <p class="what">
                    Building a construction project in a virtual environment offers many key benefits. One of the most obvious of these is having the ability to test a number of factors without the time and cost of building the structure, reducing the number of errors present in the completed building.
One important factor that needs to be thoroughly tested is the viability of an architectural design. For many years, human judgement and scale models were the only methods to determine whether a structure was viable or not. As we know, human judgement can be highly, and sometimes intentionally, erroneous and scale models cannot fully simulate the environment the structure must withstand.
Not only can the viability of a building be tested before it’s built, construction workers and employees can actually explore it. Feedback about a design from this is phenomenal, being able to pick up even small details such as whether a worker can fit in within a space.

As technology progresses, virtual reality gaming hardware has matured to the point that VR headsets offer a great experience with little lag or nausea, two areas that had presented problems historically. Some VR headsets on the market include HTC Vive, Occulus Rift, Microsoft Hololens, Samsung VR, Virtual reality gaming is the application of a three-dimensional (3-D) artificial environment to computer games. Virtual reality environments are created with VR software and presented to the user in such a way that they supercede the real-world environment, creating suspension of disbelief and helping the user experience the VR  environment as real.
At its simplest, a VR game might involve a 3-D image that can be explored interactively on a computing device by manipulating keys, mouse or touchscreen. More sophisticated and immersive examples include VR headsets, wrap-around display screens and VR rooms augmented with wearable computers and sensory components, such as scents and haptics devices for tactile feedback.
VR gaming has been dreamed about almost as long as video games -- and especially 3D games -- have existed. Prior to the development of compact technology, VR gaming used projector rooms or multiple screens. VR gaming control may involve a standard keyboard and mouse, game controllers or motion capture methods. More complex VR rooms may include treadmill floors or similar methods to further the user’s sense of freedom of movement and feelings of immersion within the virtual environment. In other VR gaming setups, the user may PlayStation VR and Google Cardboard. Most of these offer motion sensing controllers and a tracker to work in concert with the headset. Some offer room-scale VR capabilities while others are designed to be used in a seated or stationary position. In addition to entertainment, VR games can be used for various types of training and for virtual reality therapy.
VR gaming is distinct from augmented reality gaming, which involves the integration of digital content with the user’s real-world environment.
