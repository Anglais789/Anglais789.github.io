        <h1>Playstation VR</h1>
        <p>
            PlayStation VR, known by the codename Project Morpheus during development, is a virtual reality headset developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment,which launched on October 13, 2016.
            It was designed to be fully functional with the PlayStation 4 home video game console. In
            certain games and demos for the VR, the player wearing the headset acts separately from
            other players without the headset. The PlayStation VR system can output a picture to both
            the PlayStation VR headset and a television simultaneously, with the television either
            mirroring the picture displayed on the headset, or displaying a separate image for
            competitive or cooperative gameplay. PlayStation VR works with either the standard
            DualShock 4 controller or the PlayStation Move controllers.
            The PlayStation VR has a 5.7 inch OLED panel, with a display resolution of 1080p.The
            headset also has a processor box which enables the Social Screen video output to the
            television, as well as process the 3D audio effect, and uses a 3.5mm headphone jack.The
            headset also has nine positional LEDs on its surface for the PlayStation Camera to track 360
            degree head movement.
            As of February 19, 2017, PlayStation VR had sold 915,000 units.
