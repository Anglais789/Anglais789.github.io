                        How does VR work? How does wearable tech make you think you're standing on Mars when you're actually about to bump into the kitchen counter? Well, with the army of virtual reality headsets ever expanding, we'll be explaining how they work.
                        While devices generally take the same form, how they project imaging in front of our eyes varies greatly. The likes of the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift provide PC-based operations, though major players such as Google and Samsung offer more affordable, smartphone-based headsets. Sony have also managed to crack the console scene with Playstation VR.

                        Once your headset and power source are secured, some kind of input is also required for you to connect - whether this is through head tracking, controllers, hand tracking, voice, on-device buttons or trackpads.
                        Total immersion is what everyone making a VR headset, game or app is aiming towards - making the virtual reality experience so real that we forget the computer, headgear and accessories and act exactly as we would in the real world. So how do we get there?
